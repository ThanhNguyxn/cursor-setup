# Publish to PyPI when a GitHub Release is published
#
# This workflow automatically builds and publishes the package to PyPI
# whenever you create a new release on GitHub.
#
# Setup required:
# 1. Go to PyPI.org and create an API token for your project
# 2. Go to GitHub repo Settings > Secrets > Actions
# 3. Add a secret named PYPI_API_TOKEN with your PyPI token
#
# Usage:
# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml
# 2. Commit and push
# 3. Go to GitHub > Releases > Create a new release
# 4. Tag it with the version (e.g., v2.0.0)
# 5. Publish the release
# 6. This workflow will automatically publish to PyPI
