## What is this?

**cursor-init** creates a `.cursorrules` file in your project folder. This file tells [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) how to write code specifically for your tech stack (Python, React, Flutter, etc.).

**Before:** You Google for rules, copy-paste from random GitHub gists, hope they work...

**After:** Run one command and you're done! ✨

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install cursor-init
```

That's it! Now you can use `cursor-init` anywhere.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### ⚡ Quick Start (Fastest Way)

Already know what you want? Just run:

```bash
cursor-init install python
```

Replace `python` with your stack: `nextjs`, `flutter`, `java-spring`, `laravel`, `vue`, `react`, `rust`, `golang`, `svelte`...

**Done!** A `.cursorrules` file is now in your project folder. 🎉

```

Want to see what's inside before installing?

```bash
cursor-init show flutter
```

### 🔗 Pro Mode (Install from Any URL)

Found a custom `.cursorrules` file online? Install it directly:

```bash
cursor-init install --url https://example.com/my-rules.txt
```

**Real-world example** — Install TypeScript rules from awesome-cursorrules:

```bash
cursor-init install --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules/main/rules/typescript-cursorrules-prompt-file/.cursorrules
```

This is perfect for:
- 🏢 **Teams**: Share a company-wide rules URL with your team
- 🧪 **Experiments**: Try community rules before they're officially added
- 🎯 **Custom setups**: Use your own private rules file

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Local templates** are bundled with the package (always available offline)
2. **Remote templates** are fetched from our [community registry](https://github.com/ThanhNguyxn/cursor-init/blob/main/rules.json)
3. If you're offline, it silently falls back to local templates only

This means:
- ✅ Works offline with built-in templates
- ✅ Gets the latest community templates when online
- ✅ Never fails due to network issues

---
