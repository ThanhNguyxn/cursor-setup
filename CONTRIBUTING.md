## The Easiest Way to Contribute

**Add a template to `rules.json`** — our community-driven registry!

This file contains URLs to cursor rules from around the internet. When users run `cursor-init list`, they see templates from this file.

You don't need to write any Python code. Just add a URL and description!

---

## How to Add a New Template

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top of [this page](https://github.com/ThanhNguyxn/cursor-init).

### Step 2: Edit `rules.json`

Open the `rules.json` file and add your template to the `"templates"` section:

```json
{
  "templates": {
    "existing-template": { ... },
    
    "your-template-name": {
      "name": "Display Name",
      "description": "Short description (under 60 characters)",
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/.cursorrules",
      "author": "your-github-username",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Follow These Rules

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Human-readable name (e.g., "Django", "Ruby on Rails") |
| `description` | ✅ | Brief description, under 60 characters |
| `url` | ✅ | **Raw** URL to the cursorrules file (must start with `https://`) |
| `author` | ✅ | GitHub username or source attribution |
| `tags` | ✅ | Array of relevant tags (language, framework, etc.) |

### Step 4: Test Your URL

Make sure your URL works! Open it in a browser — it should show raw text, not a GitHub page.

✅ **Good URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules/main/rules/laravel-tall-stack-best-practices/.cursorrules
```

❌ **Bad URL:**
```
https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules/blob/main/rules/laravel-tall-stack-best-practices/.cursorrules
```

### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request

1. Commit your changes with a clear message:
   ```
   feat: add Django template
   ```

2. Push to your fork

3. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch

4. Fill in the PR template describing your addition

## Template Guidelines

### ✅ DO:

- **Use reliable sources** — Link to well-maintained repositories
- **Include comprehensive rules** — Templates should cover coding style, best practices, and common patterns
- **Keep descriptions concise** — Under 60 characters works best in the CLI table
- **Use lowercase keys** — Template keys should be `kebab-case` (e.g., `ruby-rails`, not `Ruby_Rails`)
- **Test the URL** — Make sure it returns raw text content

### ❌ DON'T:

- Link to temporary or personal gists that might disappear
- Add duplicate templates (check existing ones first)
- Include placeholder or incomplete rules
- Use URLs that require authentication
